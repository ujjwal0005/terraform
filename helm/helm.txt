Helm automates the creation, packaging, configuration, and deployment of Kubernetes applications by combining configuration files into a single reusable package. In short, Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Automating this work helps developers working with microservices.

In a microservices architecture, you create more microservices as the application grows, making it increasingly difficult to manage. Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration technology, simplifies the process by grouping multiple microservices into a single deployment. But managing Kubernetes applications across the development lifecycle brings its own set of challenges, including version management, resource allocation, updating, and rollbacks.

Helm provides one of the most accessible solutions to this problem, making deployments more consistent, repeatable, and reliable. In this article, youâ€™ll learn about Helm and its use cases, and how to decide if it will work for your Kubernetes projects.
